Point of Care
Invitro Diagnostics
Introduction
This application was created to control the Point of Care Invitro Diagnostics (POCIVD) Demo and was developed in C++ using QT, 
which is a Cross-platform application development platform. The purpose of this application is for the user (physician) to present 
their ID badge (RFID card) and then perform an analysis of a test strip. The test strip consists of a patient’s ID in the form 
of a barcode on one end. On the other end, there are test containing a line labeled “C” or “T”. Depending on the sequence of lines, 
the test results can either be negative, positive, or invalid.

Properties
The QT framework was used to take advantage of its cross-compiling ability which allows the development of C++ applications that can be built and hosted on the G3 running a Linux-based OS.
