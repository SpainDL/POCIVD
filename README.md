The Point of Care Invitro Diagnostics application was created to control the (POCIVD) Demo and was developed in C++ using QT, 
which is a Cross-platform application development platform. The purpose of this application is for the user (physician) to present 
their ID badge (RFID card) and then perform an analysis of a test strip. The test strip consists of a patient’s ID in the form 
of a barcode on one end. On the other end, there are test containing a line labeled “C” or “T”. Depending on the sequence of lines, 
the test results can either be negative, positive, or invalid.

Properties
The QT framework was used to take advantage of its cross-compiling ability which allows the development of C++ applications that can be built and hosted on the G3 running a Linux-based OS.
Cross Compilation to G3 Display. Please download "POCIVD1_1 read me" for full project description, link below. For non code related demo instructions, such as setup instructions and running the demo
